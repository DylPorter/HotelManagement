# HotelManagement

A GUI program created in Python for the culminating project in the ICS3U Grade 11 Computer Science course

Created in Python, GUI from the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library.

### Features:
 * Simple graphical user interface (GUI)
 * Login & Register system
 * Room booking with checkout calculations
 * File reading/writing for local storage of room keys, user IDs, and manager details

2 directories are automatically created: `RoomKeys` and `UserIDs`.

Directories must be kept in the same path as the `HotelRegistration.py` file to work properly.
